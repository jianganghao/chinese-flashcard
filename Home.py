st.title('Hassle-free Flashcard')

st.markdown('-------')
st.write('After spending considerable time searching online, I was unable to find a suitable flashcard app to help my kids review words effectively. The existing options either were not in good shape, required registration, or bombarded us with commercials. In response, I decided to create this simple and user-friendly app. It is designed to help parents, tutors, and teachers quickly guide students through word reviews without any distractions.')

st.write('While developing the flashcard app, I initially attempted to utilize GPT-4 and Claude 3.5. However, after spending two hours crafting prompts, I realized I needed to take a different approach. Ultimately, I ended up creating the app largely by hand, although I did borrow a few lines of code from AI-generated suggestions. This experience highlighted that there is still significant progress to be made in the realm of AI-generated programming.')
